Problem Statement
You are given strings S and T consisting of lowercase English letters. Determine whether T is a (contiguous) substring of S.

Do one of the following.
i) Delete the first character in X.
ii) Delete the last character in X.
For instance, the tag is a (contiguous) substring of voltage, while ace is not a (contiguous) substring of atcoder.
